      <title>Vulprisian Octal System</title>

      <introduction>
        <p>
          This publication is a study in early Vulprisian mathematics. This first volume will introduce the 
          Vulprisian mathematics system, its common notation, structure and the basic operations that will be the 
          foundation for the concepts that follow. This volume is directed at students who have a complete grasp of 
          the foundational mathe- matics needed for algebra, calculus, etc., as being able to use multiplication, 
          division, addition and subtraction are needed to translate between Vulprisian base-8 (octal number system) 
          and Terran base-10 (decimal number system). There generally will be no need for an exhaustive explanation 
          of the Vulprisian names for their numbers as humans will understand more when numbers are translated to 
          their system.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapter 1 introduces the Vulprisian number system as well as the initial op- erations of addition, 
          subtraction, multiplication and division. The chapter also will introduce the symbols and generally 
          practiced formats for displaying such opera- tions. The chapter will then combine these operations before 
          introducing fractional numbers within the Vulprisian system.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to introduce these most elementary of operations from a new perspective as Terran students 
          may be completely unfamiliar with performing cal- culations within a numerical-base other than 10, having 
          utilized the decimal system for their entire academic careers. Therefore the main objective of this chapter 
          is to demonstrate that an octal system functions in much the same way with the caveat that the student 
          commits to memory the threshold numbers that govern the number 8 raised to progressively larger values 
          (81 = 8, 82 = 64, 83 = 512, 84 = 4, 096, ...)    
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapter will conclude with the introduction of the Vulprisian Hierarchy of Operations explained 
          thoroughly, providing another major component to the under- standing of elementary Vulprisian mathematics.

        <title>Vulprisian Digits and Place Value</title>
        <p>Vulprisians use eight unique symbols to denote single-digit numbers.</p>
        <p>Each of these symbols on their own is called a ehmuhehkk (Vulprisian: ;fj digit). The current symbols used for each digit are about 3500 Vulprisian years old and are believed to be symbols that were easy for a quadrupedal Vulprisian to use a front paw to draw the character in the sand, dirt or on a clay tablet. The digit names are proper names within the Modern Vulprisian language, which generally consist of two to four syllables.</p>
        <p>Vulprisians have had dozens of numeral sets in their history, however the current system has been the most prominent in historical written records. Some sets were of bases other than 8 but the current system is the accepted system within society.</p>
