# VAoS Book SVM-1

Elementary Mathematics in the Vulprisian System is the first volume of the Series in Vulprisian Mathematics. The series code is SVM and the book number is 1.

The main objective of this publication, and to a larger extent the first volumes of the SVM series, is to introduce the reader to the base-8 Vulptisian mathematics system.

## This is a work in progress.

The volume is primarily being written in LaTeX and will be distributed both through the web and through a traditional textbook. The writing and development of the LaTeX publication is done simultaniously utilizing a local Texshop installation and the online editor Overleaf. As sections and chapters are completed they will be updated in parallel here to test the readability of the publication from a web perspective.

## Assistance will ultimately be needed in getting the Vulprisian font to display on the web publication.

A special .ttf font package has been created in order to display the Vulprisian digits and glyphs of their modern alphabet. This will be needed within the web version as all mathematical examples use the Vulprisian digits. Names of Vulprisian mathematicians, historical figures, place names, etc., will also be needed.
